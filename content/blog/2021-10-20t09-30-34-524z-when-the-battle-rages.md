title: WHEN THE BATTLE RAGES
description: "Midweek Bible Study: Put on the Whole Armor of God Series No. 2"
---
John [](<>)10:10 KJV

The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\
\
Rages: violent and uncontrolled\
\
**PREPOSITION**

This invisible war is being waged on earth.\
\
Satan fights to maintain control of the kingdom of this world. He does not want to come under God's authority. The battle also rages within the hearts; minds; and souls of men and women. Satan blinds the minds of the non-believers and pre-believers and attacks the believers in the areas of worship; the Word; their daily walk and work for God.\
\
***I. HOW THE BATTLE STARTED.***\
\
In Revelation 12:7 and 9

\
7. And there was war in heaven: Michael (the captain) and his angels (warrior angel) fought against the dragon (Lucifer who became Satan) and the dragon fought and his angels,

9. And the great dragon (Satan) was cast out (in heaven to the garden of eden), that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\
\
Very clear that the invisible war was started in heaven with an angel named Lucifer who was a beautiful angel created by God and was part of the Kingdom of God. Because of  Lucifer's pride he wanted to take over God's Kingdom. So, God cast Lucifer and the rebellious angel out of heaven and they formed their own kingdom on earth. 

Isaiah 14:12-17 NLT and Ezekiel 28:12-19 NLT

Lucifer became known as Satan and the angels who followed him in rebellion as demons. 

Demon spirit can enter; torment; control; and use humans who belongs Satan's kingdom and they motivate evil acts which are done by men and women. Satan directs his demons in their evil activities. He combine these powerful forces with the world and the flesh to war against all mankind. 

We will study about the rebellion of Lucifer in detail later in course. \
\
***II. REASONS BEHIND THE CONFLICT.*** 

In Genesis 2 man was originally created in the image of God and for the glory of God. 

In Genesis 3 The invisible war against man started with the first temptation in the Garden of Eden. 

1. Now the serpent was more subtil (deceitful) than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
2. And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
4. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
5. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

Satan caused Adam and Eve to sin. In result, all men inherited the sinful nature and committed individual acts of sin due to his nature.

Romans 5:12 NKJV

Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:

That is why as a christian still  we are prone to sin and it resulted a invisible war in the spiritual realm. 

Romans 7:15-17 NLT Paul struggling with sin. 

1. I don’t really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don’t do it. Instead, I do what I hate.
2. But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that the law is good.
3. So I am not the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.
4. And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I want to do what is right, but I can’t.

Because of sin, man was separated from God and condemned to death. But God loved man so much that He made a special plan to save him from sin. \
\
Romans 5:8-9 NKJV

1. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
2. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. [John [](<>)3:16]

1 Corinthians 2:8 (NIV) GOD WISDOM REVEALED BY THE SPIRIT. 

None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\
\
Through our belief in Jesus as God; confession of repentance from sin and water baptism in the Name of Jesus, and receiving the Holy Ghost with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues men and women can be release from the power of the enemy. 

The death burial, burial and resurrection of Jesus did not only result in salvation from sin. It also defeated the enemy, Satan. \
\
1 John 3:8 NKJV

"...For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil".



THE QUESTION

But if Satan is defeated, why does the war still rages? The reason is because we are still in flesh; we are still prone to sin.

Although Satan is defeated by blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony; we are still living in the territory of our enemy; which is still occupied by enemy resistance and forces.

The reason behind this conflict is our enemy Satan wants us to steal; and kill; and to destroy. He is trying to keep men captive in sin through deceptive methods of  enticing men and women to temporary lust and sinful living. This conflict will continue  until the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

***III. WHAT IS SPIRITUAL WARFARE.*** 

Spiritual warfare is the analysis of spiritual principles and it include active participation in the invisible spiritual war. It include study of the opposing forces of Good and evil. 

One of the most effective strategies of Satan is to keep believers ignorant of his devices. 

2 Corinthians 2:11 NKJV

Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.

Paul said it is important to know satan strategies. We should learn and understand the scriptural basis to know Satan strategies. 

We must recognize that all battles of life; whether in physical; spiritual; emotional mental; financial or with human personalities are only outward manifestation of a spiritual cause.   

Read the book of Job. 



***IV. WHICH KINGDOM YOU BELONG?***\
\
In the natural world a king is the sovereign ruler of a kingdom. All the territory and people in the kingdom belongs to him. He has the power of life and death over his subjects. The same is true in the spiritual world. You either part of the Kingdom of God or kingdom of Satan. Ether God or Satan has power over your life. 

In Matthew 13:38; one of the parable told by Jesus that all men are ether part of kingdom of Satan or the Kingdom of God. 

Matthew 13 Parable of the wheat and weeds.

<!--StartFragment-->

1. Here is another story Jesus told: “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field.
2. But that night as the workers slept, his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat, then slipped away.
3. When the crop began to grow and produce grain, the weeds also grew.

Explained. 

1. Then, leaving the crowds outside, Jesus went into the house. His disciples said, “Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.”
2. Jesus replied, “The Son of Man is the farmer who plants the good seed.
3. The field is the world, and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.

People enter the kingdom of the Satan through natural birth. The Bible teaches that all men are born in sin. This means that they have a basic sin nature or the "seed" within; their natural inclination is to do evil.

Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.

Romans [](<>)5:12 KJV

Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:

Romans [](<>)3:23 KJV

Romans [](<>)3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

Because we are born with sinful nature, we have all at one time been part of the Kingdom of Satan. All who remain sinners remains part of the kingdom of Satan.

The whole message of God's written Word, The Holy Bible, is to appeal to man to moved from the kingdom of Satan to the Kingdom of God 

WHICH KINGDOM YOU BELONG?

* Are you on the side of Good or Evil?
* Are you part of Satan's kingdom or God's Kingdom.
* Are you victim or victor in the invisible war.
